# About Climbing Hub

Climbing Hub is here to help you get better at climbing.

## Go Climb!

We believe that the #1 way to get better at climbing is to climb. Simple. End
of story. Go do it!

But... whether it's a job, school, responsibilities, or an injury it's a bit
unfair to expect you to climb 24/7. No worries.

## Live and Breathe it Too!

The second best way to get better at climbing is by immersing yourself in the
sport. Hanging out with folks that climb, reading books on it, or watching
videos on it will all help you get more familiar with all aspects climbing
vocabulary, verabally, mentally and physically.

We've put together some of our favorite climbing videos. This collection is by
no means comprehensive but we think it's a great place to start if you're new
to the sport.

Why only videos? Climbing is a physical sport and we learn through imitation.
Hearing about techniques will only get you so far. It's important to see
someone else do it. And if we're going to see someone do it, let's watch the
best in the world!

## For Parents of Athletes

If your child is interested in getting better, then as always, they should climb
more! A consistent three days a week when they're starting out is a great goal.

But in addition, we simply cannout overstate how impactful immersion is. A
family movie night where everyone is geeking on climbing is awesome for stoke!
Watching someone great project (work out) a climb exposes them to technique and
mindset! And, best for last, following pro climbing as a family is almost
guarunteed to cement a lifetime of interest!
