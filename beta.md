# All About That Beta

Beta is typically advice on how to complete a specific climb. But if you're new
to climbing, most exposure to techniques is going to help you send what you're
working on. Here are some great resources to learn and practice techniques.

## [Bouldering Progression Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp_B_1n9LFqWIB0nCQBs2x7rJzNOgw1qo) - [Movement for Climbers](https://www.youtube.com/@movementforclimbers/playlists)

This is probably the most approachable and best bang-for-your-buck playlist on
climbing. Start with [Novice | V0, V1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJNAC9zi8gg&list=PLp_B_1n9LFqWIB0nCQBs2x7rJzNOgw1qo&index=5&pp=iAQB)
and work your way through the series as you improve!

This playlist is a grab-bag of short introductions to techniques. It's awesome
for folks who are new to climbing as it'll expose you to the fundamentals, show
you how to do them, and give you the verbal vocabulary to chat about a climb
with folks at the gym.
