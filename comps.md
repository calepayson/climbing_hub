# Competition

You should always try to copy the best. In a sport like climbing this doesn't
always mean the people winning competitions but it is a great place to start.

## [IFSC World Cup](https://www.youtube.com/@sportclimbing/streams)

The Internation Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) runs all the major global
climbing competitions. The most relevant is the World Cup Series, a series of
climbing competitions throughout the year which crown a champ in the disciplines
of bouldering, lead, and speed. [You can find the schedule of these events here](https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/calendar/index)
(sort by Region:World for the good stuff).

These competitions are long and therefore best for casual watching (at least at
first). Throw it on during dinner with the volume down low and turn it up for
the exciting bits!
