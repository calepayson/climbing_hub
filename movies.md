# Movies

Just a few essentials.

## [REEL ROCK](https://reelrocktour.com/collections/films)

A massive collection of 19 different climbing films, each arranged as a group
a few short films. Guaranteed to get you pumped to climb. Best seen in person
([Here's the calendar of showings](https://reelrocktour.com/pages/tour-calendar)).

Just go watch it if you haven't.

## [Valley Uprising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o86TpaSBcWw)

The best climbing documentary set right in our backyard. Valley Uprising covers
the history climbing in Yosemite. Since much of that history is sex, drugs, and
rock-and-roll we don't recommend this one to the youth.

## [The Dawn Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edfw9ip9sCQ)

I'll be honest, I haven't seen this one yet. We should both watch it. As a heads
up, one family who watched it said it was a bit shocking so maybe not one for
the younger youth.
